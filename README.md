# Path Traced Rendering
This project aims to create a real-time path traced renderer. It is made using C++ and OpenGL. It will provide photo-realistic images with global illumination, containing both real-time rendering and the ability to render an image to a file.

## Plans
- Scene management
- Basic ray traced rendering
- OpenGL abstraction
- Lighting
- Path traced lighting
- Global illumination
- Interaction

## Dependencies
- GLM (https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
